# About SleepAudit

SleepAudit exists to make **better sleep simple**.  
We publish **evidence-based guides** and **independent product reviews**â€”from mattresses and bedding to **supplements, routines, and sleep science**.  

Our approach: **clear answers, grounded in research, written for real people.**

## Who We Are

The **SleepAudit Team** â€” researchers, writers, and testers focused on separating hype from real, usable insights.

## What We Cover

- **Sleep environment:** mattresses, pillows, sheets, temperature regulation.  
- **Supplements & science:** melatonin, magnesium, herbal blends, and emerging researchâ€”always covered with citations and disclaimers.  
- **Lifestyle & routines:** circadian rhythms, blue-light exposure, diet, and daily habits that affect rest.  

Our focus is **informational first**: education you can trust, before recommendations.

---

## How We Review

- **Methods:** Products are tested against consistent checklists (comfort, durability, safety, andâ€”when relevantâ€”cooling, weave, GSM, fiber).  
- **Evidence:** For supplements and health claims, we cite peer-reviewed studies and expert consensus.  
- **Transparency:** We disclose affiliate relationships; links are marked `rel="sponsored"`.  
- **Updates:** As products change or new research emerges, pages are revised and timestamped.  

---

## Editorial Standards

- **Evidence comes first.** All claims must be verifiable with citations.  
- **Education vs. recommendations.** Informational content is separate from product reviews.  
- **No pay-to-play.** We never sell placement or guaranteed positive coverage.

## Affiliates & Disclosures

Some links are affiliate links (marked on-page). If you buy through one, we may earn a commissionâ€”at no extra cost to you.  

Affiliate revenue **never changes** our criteria or rankings. Our commitment is to **trustworthy sleep information above all else**.
