# Melatonin Timing & Doses: How to Use It Safely

Melatonin is a circadian signal, not a knockout drug. Getting value from it is mostly about **when** you take it and **how much** you use. This guide summarizes best-practice timing windows, conservative dose ranges, and travel strategies, with safety reminders along the way.

## Quick Start

- For general sleep onset: **0.5–1 mg immediate‑release**, taken **30–60 minutes before bed**. Increase slowly only if needed.
- For delayed sleep phase (DSWPD): **0.3–3 mg** taken **3–5 hours before your natural bedtime** (roughly 3–5 h before DLMO). Keep the schedule for 1–2 weeks.
- For jet lag (eastbound): begin **0.5–3 mg** in the early evening at destination, pair with **bright morning light** and **dim evenings**.

## Choosing a Form

- **Immediate‑release (IR):** best for sleep onset and for phase‑shifting (clock changes).
- **Prolonged‑release (PR/MR):** broader curve; commonly used in older adults (e.g., 2 mg PR 1–2 h pre‑bed).

---

## Dose Ranges (Conservative)

- Onset help (adults): **0.5–1 mg IR**, 30–60 min pre‑bed; may titrate to **3–5 mg** only if needed.
- DSWPD/phase advance: **0.3–3 mg**, **3–5 h before DLMO** (≈ 4–6 h before habitual bedtime).
- Jet lag: **0.5–3 mg** for several evenings after arrival (especially eastbound).

<Callout type="study" title="Older adults">
Endogenous melatonin declines with age. Trials of **2 mg prolonged‑release** show improved sleep quality in adults ≥55.

## Jet‑Lag Playbook (Eastbound)

1. Evening melatonin (0.5–3 mg) at local time for several days.
2. Morning bright light exposure; avoid late‑night light.
3. Keep caffeine to the first half of the day.

Westbound travel generally benefits more from morning light and avoiding late‑evening melatonin.

## Safety Notes

- Short‑term use is generally well tolerated; possible headache, dizziness, or next‑day grogginess.
- Interactions include **CYP1A2** (e.g., fluvoxamine), anticoagulants; smoking/caffeine alter kinetics.
- For children, use clinician guidance; prioritize schedule and light first.

<Callout type="safety" title="Product quality">
Prefer **USP/NSF** certified brands. Analyses have found dose mislabeling and rare contamination in OTC products.

## Non‑sedative supports

For comfort (not timing), consider **[Glycine 3 g](/supplements/glycine-for-sleep)** about 30–60 minutes before bed.

## FAQs

**How long before bed should I take melatonin?**  
Usually **30–60 minutes** for onset; **3–5 hours before biological night** for shifting the clock.

**What’s the lowest effective dose?**  
Many adults respond to **0.5–1 mg IR**; higher isn’t always better.

**How many nights until it helps?**  
Onset benefits can appear the first night; clock shifts take **several days** of consistent timing plus light.
